File Content,"The Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW) Study was established in 1979 by several federal government departments (Natural Resources Canada; Environment and Climate Change Canada; and Fisheries and Oceans Canada) to study the impacts of acid rain on aquatic and forest ecosystems but has since expanded to include other research on toxic contaminants, forest harvesting, habitat modification, and climate change. The TLW is a mixed hardwood forest with a 10.5 km squared area in the Canada Shield that drains into Lake Superior and has been the focus of many interdisciplinary, whole-ecosystem studies on environmental issues. Benthic invertebrates, or insects found at the bottom of waterbodies, can be key indicators of stream health and play important roles in nutrient cyclng and the food chain. In 1995, a project within the TLW aimed to evaluate how stream ecosystems respond to tree harvesting, which involved long-term surveys of benthic invertebrate communities pre- and post-harvest. Three stream catchments (c31, c33, c34) were harvested at different intensities in the summer of 1997 and were compared to multiple undisturbed catchments. Alongside the invertebrate data, corresponding stream habitat surveys, streamside litterfall traps, leaf decomposition, deposition of stream particulate matter, and standing sediment bedload data was collected during the same period. The data was collected from 1995-2009 by researchers at the Canadian Forest Service (Great Lakes Forestry Centre). This dataset is a rare and valuable resource because there are very few existing long-term datasets of benthic invertebrates from the same locations, and because this dataset is integrated with other biological and chemical datasets within the broader TLW database stored at the Open Government data repository. For an overview of other types of data available from the TLW, see https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14109, and for a complete list of publications that have been produced from data collected at this site, see https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/turkey-lakes-watershed-study/publications.html.",,,

Notes,Laboratory Methods and detection limits for each measurement are provided below the Data Dictionary.,,,
Notes,Trees were harvested in the summer of 1997. Riparian buffers were waived for experimental purposes; prescription was to selectively harvest right to stream edge although no machine traffic was allowed within 3 meters of the stream channels. Catchment 31 harvested at high intensity diameter limit cut (all trees greater than 20 centimeteres were felled then delimbed and removed; all trees between 10-20 centimeter diameter were felled) (average 89% basal area removal); catchment 33 harvested at low intensity selection cut (average 29% basal area removal); catchment 34U harvested at medium intensity shelterwood cut (average 42% removal); catchment 34L harvested at high intensity diameter limit cut (average 89% basal area removal) (34U 34M 34L are in the same catchment; 34L is below the road down to Norburg; 34M and 34L are contiguous above the road; 34M is from the road to 310 meters upstream and then 34U begins at 320 meters).,,,
Notes,Non-harvested reference catchments were 32; 37; 38; 39; 42; 60; 96; 97; 98; 99 (99U is above the road and 99L is below the road. 99UU and 99UL are respectively more upstream of 99U); 100; 101; 102; NC (Norburg Creek; NCU is upper and NCL is lower).,,,
Notes,Catchment 42 was established as a reference site but due to road construction activities in 1997 an alternate reference catchment 97 was established in 1998.,,,
Notes,Invertebrate density data can be converted to count data by multiplying all values by 0.33 meter squared (the area of the surber sampler). ,,,
Notes,Invertebrate density data includes early instar insects and broken insects.,,,
Notes,Invertebrates were identified to genus level where possible and classification information was obtained using taxonomic serial numbers (TSN) to query the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) (retrieved 2021-10-06; www.itis.gov).,,,
Notes,The subfamily taxon ID Chloroperlinae contains data for the Suwalia and Sweltsa genera.,,,
Notes,The class taxon ID Clitellata replaced invalid taxon names Oligochaeta and Hirundea (Integrated Taxonomic Information System; retrieved 2021-08-26; www.itis.gov).,,,
Notes,The genus taxon ID Heterocloeon replaced invalid taxon name Baetis amplus which is no longer part of the Baetis genera (Integrated Taxonomic Information System; retrieved 2021-08-26; www.itis.gov).,,,
Notes,Leaf disks were placed in streams to measure decomposition by microbes. Ten disks were placed in a 500 micron mesh bag and anchored in the stream for a single replicate. The position of leaf disks in the stream were either anchored in the stream (surface) or anchored and buried 1 centimeter below the surface of the streambed (buried). 5 to 8 replicates were placed per catchment.,,,
Notes,"Leaf packs were placed in streams to measure decomposition by invertebrates and microbes. Leaf packs consisted of whole dried leaves in coarse mesh bags that were anchored to the stream bottom. In 2003, the position of leaf packs in the stream were either anchored in the stream (surface) or anchored and buried 1 centimeter below the surface of the streambed (buried). 8 replicates were placed per catchment.",,,
Notes,Litter traps were placed at 10 meter intervals on alternate stream banks at each site; avoiding obvious obstructions like large overhanging boughs or occasional young conifers. Traps were 0.76 x 076 meter squared; 0.14 meters tall with 2 millimeter mesh screens on the bottom. Ten traps were placed per catchment.,,,
Notes,Blow-in litter traps measured 0.46 x 0.76 meters but area assumes the long dimension squared (0.5776 meter squared) and so are equivalent to the amount deposited in a normal litter trap if the side wall was down.,,,
Notes,Tubes for sediment deposition measured very fine particulate organic and inorganic matter. Tubes were 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes with a 28 millimeter diameter and 11 centimeter long (area is 0.000615 meter squared) that were buried 9 centimeters deep in the streambed while leaving 2 centimeters protruding at right angles to the streamflow. Tubes were placed at 5 meter intervals in the stream and numbered 1 to 10 going upstream. Tubes were positioned to avoid bedrock/large rubble/sand/silt where the tube would not remain upright and were placed in narrow stretches of level water or near the end of pools which would not dry over the season. Subsamples were measured if there was a lot of material and values were multiplied to get the original sample volume. ,,,
Notes,Rings for sediment deposition captured particles from 1 to 4 millimeter (coarse particulate organic matter) and from 0.25 to 1 millimeter (fine particular organic matter). Ring traps consisted of a 38 centimeter diameter plastic ring with a 5 centimeter wall with an area of 0.1 meter squared and a 0.5 millimeter mesh collection bag. Six traps were placed per catchment. Rings were set in the streams by excavating a shallow depression in the stream bottom; placing the ring and the mesh bag on the bottom; then returning the excavted material to the stream bottom inside the trap. Particulate from the traps was preserved in 4% formalin then passed through an elutriator column where organic and buoyant particles were bubbled out. Elutriated contents were partitioned through corase or fine sieves and particles greater than 4 millimeters were discarded. ,,,
Notes,Ring samples collected in fall of 1997 are considered to be pre-harvest because particles in those traps would have been primarily derived from the previous year's litter.,,,
Notes,Cores for standing sediment bedload were replicated ten times within the same 15 meter sampling section for each stream. Core samplers had a diameter of 17.5 centimeters (area of 0.025 meter squared) and were pushed 5 centimeters into the substrate. Large particles were removed by hand (coarse and fine particulate) and the remaining substrate was stirred vigorously to suspend the fine particles in the water column. A bilge pump with a 2 millimeter intake was used to pump water with suspended sediments into a collection bucket (very fine particulate) which was passed through a sieve to collect particles smaller than 0.25 millimeters. Contents were preserved in 4% formalin and suction filtered onto a 1.5 micron glass fiber filter (for very fine particle sizes 1.5-250 microns). Large substrate particles were washed through sieves to collect particles from 1-4 millimeter (coarse particulate matter) and 0.25-1 millimeter (fine particulate matter). ,,,
Notes,Stream habitat surveys were conducted once a year in each catchment. Habitat characteristics were recorded every 10 meters along the length of the stream. Catchment 34M is from the road to 310 meters upstream and then 34U begins at 320 meters.,,,
