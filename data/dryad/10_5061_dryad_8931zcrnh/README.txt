This repository contains the data used in the manuscript "Tradeoffs with growth limit generalism in complex life cycle helminths".

It is divided into 5 zip archives. Three contain the raw data used to calculate parasite generalism: "lc_database.zip", "host_records_taxonomy.zip", and "study_effort.zip". They include life cycle, host association, and study effort data, respectively. From these data, we calculated parasite generalism (and other variables) at the parasite species and stage levels. Those tables were used in the main analyses and are contained in "compiled_data_at_species_stage_level.zip". An additional archive, "simulated_life_cycles.zip", has generalism data for parasite life cycles that were simulated in real food webs. 

More details on how the data were compiled and analysed can be found in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/dbenesh82/clc_generalism
